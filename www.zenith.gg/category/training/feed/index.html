								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Hello community, Angelo “Misleading” from Zenith eSports here!</h3>
<p>Welcome to the fourth article in the “Proper Wave Management” series. (If you have not yet read the previous wave management articles, you may click the following links to visit them – <a href="http://www.zenith.gg/2016/02/22/proper-wave-management-basic-and-advanced-techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1<sup>st</sup></a> <a href="http://www.zenith.gg/2016/03/01/proper-wave-management-in-game-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2<sup>nd</sup></a> <a href="http://www.zenith.gg/2016/03/08/proper-wave-management-adapting-champion-scaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3<sup>rd</sup></a>). In our previous article, we talked about recommended wave management techniques while on an early game champion. Today, we are going to jump straight into things and finish up the wave management series and discuss recommended wave management techniques for when we pilot mid game champions or late game champions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Power-Spikes.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1648"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1648 size-large" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Power-Spikes-1024x96.png" alt="Power Spikes" width="1024" height="96" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Power-Spikes-1024x96.png 1024w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Power-Spikes-600x56.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Power-Spikes-300x28.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Power-Spikes-768x72.png 768w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Power-Spikes.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Unlike early game champions, mid game champions and late game champions are reliant on their completing their core items to stay relevant throughout the game. Until these champions have collected enough gold and purchased their core items, they look to avoid trivial skirmishes and team fights. Mid game oriented champions generally power spike when they have two to three items. Late game oriented champions generally power spike when they have three to four items. Only after these champions complete their core items and reach their power spike, they begin to look into influencing other areas of the map and taking objectives.</p>

<h3>Mid Game Champion vs</h3>
<h5>An Early Game Champion</h5>
<p><strong>BEFORE OUR POWER SPIKE ::</strong> As a mid game champion against an early game champion, our options for wave management are limited until we complete our core items. Before we reach our power spike, we should soft/slow push the lane and attempt to freeze the minion wave on our side of the lane. If our opponent tries to freeze the minion wave on his side of the lane, reset the wave as soon as possible. We need to play cautiously when the minion wave is on our opponent’s side of the lane or when a large minion wave (more than 10 minions) is approaching our tower. Wards should be placed in areas to spot our lane opponent if he/she leaves the lane to roam or if another opponent, like the enemy jungler, comes to tower dive us.</p>

<p><strong>AFTER OUR POWER SPIKE ::</strong> After we complete our core items, we should have lane advantage. We can hard/fast push our lane to prevent our opponent from roaming or recalling or create opportunities for ourselves to roam and influence other areas of the map. We can also slow/soft push to build a minion wave so we may create opportunities to take an objective or tower dive our opponent with the help of our jungler.</p>

<h5>A Mid Game Champion</h5>
<p>As a mid game champion against another mid game champion, we have several wave management techniques available to us. We can hard/fast push the lane to give ourselves an opportunity to influence other areas of the map and prevent our opponent from leaving the lane. We can also slow/soft push the minion wave to  try to freeze the minion wave on our side of the lane and try to deny our opponent from farming as much as we can. We should reset the minion wave as soon as possible if our opponent tries to freeze the minion wave on his side of the lane. While we hard/fast push, we need to establish the proper vision to tell us if the enemy jungler is nearby. If we decide to try and freeze the lane, we should still have wards to track our opponent if he/she decides to leave the lane. Keep in mind that our primary objective is to collect enough gold for our core items before making any major moves.</p>

<h5>A Late Game Champion</h5>
<p>As a mid game champion against a late game champion, we can hard/fast push the lane to give ourselves an opportunity to roam or invade the enemy jungle or we can try to freeze the minion wave on our side of the lane. It would be in our favor to try and freeze the minion wave on our side of the lane so we can try and deny gold from our late game opponent – delaying his inevitable power spike. Since our opponent is a late game champion, it is unlikely he will leave the lane to skirmish or team fight if we can successful freeze the minion wave. When we reach our power spike, we may focus on building the minion wave so we can tower dive our opponent or take objectives.</p>

<h3>Late Game Champion vs</h3>
<h5>An Early Game Champion</h5>
<p>As a late game champion against an early game champion, we need to accept that we have minimal control over the minion wave. Our primary objective is to farm as much gold as possible, for our core items, in the shortest amount of time possible (without dying to our opponent). The laning phase will most likely end before we finish our core items if our opponent knows how to pilot his champion. In this situation, we should focus on slow/soft pushing and freezing the minion wave on our side of the lane. Our opponent, since he has a natural advantage, may try to freeze the minion wave on his side of the lane. Try to avoid this situation by resetting the minion wave. If and only if we have a clear advantage in lane can we try to hard/fast push to force our opponent to stay in lane instead of roaming or invading our jungle</p>

<h5>A Mid Game Champion</h5>
<p><strong>BEFORE OUR POWER SPIKE ::</strong> When we are against a mid game champion as a late game champion, we have a little more wave management techniques available to us. Our primary objective is still to farm as much gold as possible, however, during the laning phase. For now, we should slow/soft push and try to freeze the minion wave on our side of the lane. If our opponent tries to freeze the minion wave on his/her side of the lane, we need to break it and reset the minion wave as soon as we can. Our opponent will hit his power spike before us because he is a mid game oriented champion. Which means that, if we are strong enough, we should hard/fast push the minion wave and prevent our opponent from influencing other lanes during his power spike. Don’t forget about the necessary wards!</p>

<p><strong>AFTER OUR POWER SPIKE ::</strong> Sometimes the laning phase will last long enough for us  to complete our items and reach our power spike. At this point in time, we should either hard/fast push the minion wave to apply constant map pressure or soft/slow push to build the minion wave. Do not freeze the minion wave any more. Now that we have reached our power spike, we do whatever is necessary to take all objectives.</p>

<h5>A Late Game Champion</h5>
<p>As a late game champion against another late game champion, the laning phase can be surprisingly dynamic (or just plain boring). Since we are both late game champions, we have relatively weak laning phases and we only desire to farm gold. But because we both have relatively weak laning phases, we can effectively bully each other in a one versus one situation. In this match up, junglers can make all the difference. With respect to lane management, it is ideal for us to slow/soft push and attempt to freeze the minion wave on our side of the lane. Hard/fast pushing our opponent is not very efficient because our opponent wants to stay in lane anyways. Another option is to slow/soft push to build the minion wave. As a late game champion, our opponent is vulnerable to tower dives if the minion wave attacking the turret is large enough. The late game versus late game champion matchup is a swing matchup. Proper warding to detect potential external influence is essential.</p>

<h3>Some Final Words</h3>
<p>By now, we should have a solid understanding of how we should approach lane management &#8211; regardless of what champion we play or what champion our opponent plays. We should also have enough wave management techniques at our disposal to adapt to uncommon or novel situations. We should hard/fast push to keep our opponents from leaving the lane. We should soft/slow push if we want to farm or try to delay our opponents from reaching their power spike. And we should build the minion wave if we want to start pressuring objectives or create opportunities to tower dive our opponent. Knowing proper wave management helps reduce the amount of uncertainty and risk that exists when we decide to enter the rift. The sooner we learn, understand, and apply effective wave management techniques the better. Don’t forget that the only way to master wave management is to practice it every chance you get. Don’t wait. Start now.</p>

Previously, we have covered the basic and advanced techniques of wave management and evaluated which situations call for which wave management technique. Today, let&#8217;s explore proper wave management with respect to the scaling of our champion and the scaling of our opponents&#8217;s champion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Early game champions are well-known for their dominant laning phase. If you try to trade with them, you may find dying or recalling earlier than you would like. Excellent examples of early game champions are LeBlanc and Pantheon. Their strongest power spike occurs during the early stages of the game, however, their power begins to wane the longer game goes on. Early game champions are typically very item-independent as their abilities have high base damage or have high utility. Their most significant power spike is when they have one two completed items. Unless our early game champion is a support oriented champion, our champion may lose its effectiveness as the number of opponents in a team fight grows . During the laning phase, these champions exert a lot of pressure and control in lane. If they are able to keep their lane opponent bunkered down under their tower, they are able to search for opportunities to influence other areas of the map.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1622 size-large" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-MGC-1-1024x96.png" alt="GD MGC 1" width="1024" height="96" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-MGC-1-1024x96.png 1024w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-MGC-1-600x56.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-MGC-1-300x28.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-MGC-1-768x72.png 768w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-MGC-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mid game champions are typically known for their two to three item power spike. Ahri, Lucian, and Gnar are good examples of mid game champions. Since they may spike during the laning phase, it is not uncommon for them to start out decently and stay relevant for the entire game. Their late game is only out shined by late game oriented champions. (No surprise here.) Mid game champions are slightly item-dependent as their abilities have only decent base damage and utility. If they try to duel an early champion too early, they may find themselves killed in action. During the laning phase, they are focused on gathering enough gold to purchase their core items. Only after purchasing their core items they look for opportunities to team fight and take objectives.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1621 size-large" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-LGC-1-1024x96.png" alt="GD LGC 1" width="1024" height="96" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-LGC-1-1024x96.png 1024w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-LGC-1-600x56.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-LGC-1-300x28.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-LGC-1-768x72.png 768w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GD-LGC-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Late game champions are known for their overwhelming power if the game lasts longer than thirty five minutes. A ticking time bomb, as many people coin it. Great examples of late game champions are Nasus, Veigar, and Vayne. If the game goes on long enough, it is excruciatingly difficult to stop them. They find passive laning phases, focused on last hitting, very attractive and they usually do not have any kill pressure in lane. The only time a late game oriented champion should be able to kill us is if the enemy jungler comes in to assist him. Late game champions are heavily item-dependent and they should avoid any and all fighting until they have the items to bolster their strength. The longer they are able to farm for gold to purchase their items, the sooner they are able to attain &#8220;unstoppable&#8221; status.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that we talked about the three main categories of champion scaling, we can talk about the recommended wave management techniques we should use in each match up with respect to our and our opponent&#8217;s champion scaling. (A small warning: things may get a little repetitive but we can get through it together. (: )</p>
<h3>An Early Game Champion  vs</h3>
<h5>An Early Game Champion</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an early game champion against another early game champion, we have several wave management techniques available to us. We can hard/fast push the lane to give ourselves an opportunity to roam and prevent our opponent from roaming at the same time or we can try to freeze the minion wave on our side of the lane and try to deny our opponent from farming as much as we can. And if our opponent tries to freeze the minion wave on his side of the lane, like we are trying to do, we should aim to reset the minion wave as soon as possible. While we hard/fast push, we need to establish the necessary vision to warn us if the enemy jungler is nearby. If we decide to try and freeze the lane, we should still have wards to track our opponent if he/she decides to leave the lane. In this match up, every advantage, no matter how small, is valuable.</p>

<h5>A Mid Game Champion</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an early game champion against a mid game champion, we are temporarily stronger than our opponent during the laning phase. We can hard/fast push the lane to give ourselves an opportunity to roam or invade the enemy jungle or we can try to freeze the minion wave on our side of the lane to deny our opponent from farming. The longer we are able to deny our opponent from gathering gold, the more we delay his mid game power spike. If our opponent tries to freeze the minion wave on his side of the lane, we need to reset the minion wave as soon as possible. Before our opponent reaches his mid game power spike, we may also try to build large minion waves against him. Large minion waves will allow us to pressure his tower in addition to creating up opportunities for us to eliminate him under his tower with the help of our jungler. When our opponent reaches his mid game power spike, however, it may become difficult to freeze the minion wave. As always, wards need to be established so we may safely hard/fast push and prevent our opponent from influencing the map.</p>

<h5>A Late Game Champion</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an early game champion against a late game champion, we should always be stronger than our opponents in lane. We need to abuse this fact as much as possible because we will, inevitably, be out scaled. We can hard/fast push the lane to give ourselves an opportunity to roam or invade the enemy jungle but it is better to try and freeze the minion wave on our side of the lane to deny our opponent from farming. Denying our opponent from farming is essential to winning because it delays his &#8220;unstoppable&#8221; status. Our opponent, if he knows what he should be doing, will definitely try and freeze the minion wave on his side of the lane. We need to reset the lane, without any delay, if this happens. If our opponent is able to freeze the minion wave on his side of the map, we will be vulnerable to jungle ganks and our opponent will be able to farm the minion wave safely. If we are unsuccessful in freezing a minion wave, and our opponent is able to reset the minion wave, we should adapt and slow/soft push the minion wave and allow it to build. With a large enough minion wave and the help of our jungler, we will have an opportunity to dive and kill our opponent because he is on a champion who is weak in the early. We can keep abusing this advantage until our opponent reaches his power spike.</p>

<h3>Some Final Words</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By now, we should have a general grasp on how we should tackle wave management as an early game champion. As we have said in previous articles, we can only improve at wave management if we actively practice it over a period of time. So we should get onto the rift, right now, with early game champions like Pantheon, LeBlanc, and Kalista. Early game champions are the easiest type of champions to practice minion wave management with because we should have lane dominance right away. You might be asking, &#8220;where&#8217;s the section for mid game and champions and late game champions???&#8221; Since mid game champions and late game champions have an extra variable to factor in, a delayed power spike, we are going to give them our attention in a separate article. For now, let us get some good wave management practice in so we are ready for the next step.</p>

<h3>Hello from the other side, Angelo &#8220;Misleading&#8221; from Zenith eSports here!</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a previous article, we talked about and</span> explained a variet<span style="font-weight: 400;">y of wave management techniques that we can use when we play League of Legends. (If you have not read the previous article, you can read the previous article <a href="http://www.zenith.gg/2016/02/22/proper-wave-management-basic-and-advanced-techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.) Although we described how to perform different wave management techniques, we did not go over when and where to use them. In this article, we are going to explore deeper into wave management so we know when and where to apply certain techniques. Let’s start with the pros and cons of hard/fast pushing and soft/slow pushing.</span></p>
<h3><a href="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-B-WM.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1474"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1474 size-large" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-B-WM-1024x96.png" alt="GD B WM" width="1024" height="96" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-B-WM-1024x96.png 1024w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-B-WM-600x56.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-B-WM-300x28.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-B-WM-768x72.png 768w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-B-WM.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></h3>
<h2>Hard/Fast Pushing</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hard-Push.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1468"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1468" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hard-Push-300x225.png" alt="Hard Push" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hard-Push-300x225.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hard-Push-600x450.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hard-Push-768x576.png 768w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hard-Push.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><br />
</a><em><strong>Defining characteristic: Active objective pressure focused on the present</strong></em></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applies consistent objective pressure<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requires little to no preparation<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opens more opportunities for us to roam/invade/recall/*teleport<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denies opportunities for our opponents to roam/invade/recall/*teleport</span></p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not optimal for building pressure<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requires at least one to player to actively influence the wave<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More susceptible to external interference</span></p>
<h2>Soft/Slow Pushing</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1470"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1470" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush-300x225.png" alt="SoftPush" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush-300x225.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush-600x450.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush-768x576.png 768w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><br />
</a><strong><i>Defining characteristic: Passive objective pressure focused on the future</i></strong></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Able to build an overwhelming source of pressure<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less susceptible to external interference<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does not require any players to actively influence at a certain point<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opens opportunities to turret dive or force objectives</span></p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gives opponents more opportunities roam/invade/recall/*teleport<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denies opportunities for you to roam/invade/recall/*teleport<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predictable source of objective pressure</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1531 size-large" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-SS-1024x96.png" alt="GD SS" width="1024" height="96" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-SS-1024x96.png 1024w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-SS-600x56.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-SS-300x28.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-SS-768x72.png 768w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GD-SS.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we know and (hopefully) understand the advantages and disadvantages of hard/fast pushing and soft/slow pushing, we can generalize when we should apply the more advanced wave management techniques. After all, advanced wave management techniques are just modified versions of basic wave management fundamentals. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resetting </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a minion wave is a modified hard/fast push. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a minion wave is a modified soft/slow push. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freezing </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a minion wave is a modified reversed soft/slow push. Below are recommendations of wave management techniques you should apply based on specific situations/objectives. Remember, that the recommendations are guidelines and not absolutes. We should always adjust our technique to match our current situation and its contingencies.</span></p>
<h5>1. Recalling</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/YouRecalling.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1572"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1572 size-full" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/YouRecalling.png" alt="YouRecalling" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/YouRecalling.png 1000w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/YouRecalling-600x360.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/YouRecalling-300x180.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/YouRecalling-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we want to recall, then we should aim to hard/fast push the minion wave. Ideally, try to reset the minion wave before recalling. By hard/fast pushing the minion wave, we give ourselves an opportunity to recall without minions pressuring our turret. We also discourage our opponent from roaming/invading/recalling/*teleporting until after he/she clears the minion wave because he/she would want to avoid any unnecessary damage to their turret.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Recalling.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1571"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1571 size-full" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Recalling.png" alt="Recalling" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Recalling.png 1000w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Recalling-600x360.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Recalling-300x180.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Recalling-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>If our opponent is looking like he wants to recall, we should hard/fast push the minion wave. By hard/fast pushing the minion wave, we can force our opponent to cancel his recall and stay to clear the minions. Canceling our opponent&#8217;s recall prevents him from doing what he wants to do: heal, buy items, etc. Essentially, we delay his/her or ability to effectively participate in team fights or delay the timing of his/her item-based power spikes. Stay cautious. Canceling recalls is not worth dying for.</p>
<h5>2. Farming</h5>
<p>If we are looking to farm because we are nearing a certain gold amount or we are a mid-game or late-game oriented champion, then we want to put our focus on freezing the minion wave on our side of the lane. Freezing the minion wave allows us to farm from the minion wave without putting ourselves in danger from over extending. If we are unable to freeze our wave, then we should aim to soft/slow push the minion wave when it is on our side of lane. When the minion wave is on our opponent&#8217;s side of the lane, aim to hard/fast push the minion wave and reset the wave. Properly alternating between hard/fast pushing and slow/soft pushing minimizes the time we are vulnerable to outside interference (enemy jungle ganks or roams).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1574"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1574 size-full" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming.png" alt="Farming" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming.png 1000w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming-600x360.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming-300x180.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Farming-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>If our opponent is looking to farm, which is true in almost all cases, then we should still focus on freezing the minion wave on our side of the lane. Freezing the minion wave puts us in a good strategic position to deny our opponent from farming, especially if our opponent cannot effectively farm from a distance. When the minion wave is successfully frozen on our side of the lane, we force our opponent to overextend to farm the minion wave. By forcing him to over extend more often, we make our opponent more vulnerable to outside interference giving us and our allies more opportunities to punish our opponent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>3. Taking Objectives</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Building.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1575"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1575 size-full" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Building.png" alt="Building" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Building.png 1000w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Building-600x360.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Building-300x180.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Building-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>If we are looking to take objectives, we should be building large minion waves. The larger the minion wave we have, the more pressure we are able to apply over a certain period of time. A minion wave 18 minions large (3 waves) pushing towards our turret is terrifying compared to a single minion wave of 6 minions. Remember, that minions are essential to taking objectives. The more minions we have when we siege a turret, the more time we have to siege and destroy the turret. Large minion waves pushing towards enemy turrets are really nice to have when a cross-map river objective is being contested. If we are able to pressure the Dragon with our team while a large minion wave is pressuring our opponent&#8217;s top turret, our opponents are forced to choose between protecting one of the two objectives: Dragon or their Turret.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Defending.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1576"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1576 size-full" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Defending.png" alt="Defending" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Defending.png 1000w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Defending-600x360.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Defending-300x180.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Defending-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>If our opponents look like they want to take an objective, they may start building large minions waves. To stop them, focus on hard/fast pushing the minion wave, in other words, clear the minion wave as fast as possible. If our opponents do not have the support of minions, they are heavily discouraged from continuing the siege (unless they have a dive-ready champion like a level 6 Alistar).</p>
<h5>4. Roaming/Invading</h5>
<p>If we are looking to make a play by roaming to a different lane or invading the enemy jungle, we should hard/fast push the minion wave and leave to roam/invade/*teleport as the minion wave resets against the enemy tower and our opponent clears the minion wave. Alternative, we should build the size of the minion wave and when the minion wave reaches the enemy turret, use that opportunity to roam, leave the lane, and/or invade the enemy jungle. By pushing the minion wave against the opponent&#8217;s tower first, we discourage our opponent from closely following us when we leave the lane. Our opponent is forced to choose between sacrificing gold/experience to chase us and staying in lane, leaving his teammates at a one-man disadvantage if a fight were to break out.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Roaming.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1578"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1578 size-full" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Roaming.png" alt="Roaming" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Roaming.png 1000w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Roaming-600x360.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Roaming-300x180.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Roaming-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>If our opponent is looking to make a play by roaming to a different lane or invading your jungle, the solution is to hard/fast push. Force him back into lane by pressuring his turret. Be careful, hard/fast pushing may make us vulnerable to our opponent&#8217;s return, especially if he comes back to lane with an ally. If forcing him back into lane seems like an unattractive solution, then do we need to do our best to follow and match his roam. A good indicator that our opponent might be looking roam/invade is if he hard/fast pushes and then goes M.I.A.</p>
<h3>Some Final Words</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wave management is a technical skill. And like most technical skills, minion wave management can only be improved through applied practice and consistent repetition. Having proper guidance lowers the difficulty of learning wave management but it does not reduces the amount of time it will take you to master the skill. Experience is the key to mastering wave management. Every day you will encounter situations you are familiar with and situations you are not familiar with. Only with enough experience in meeting and dealing with a variety of circumstances you can reliably react to novel situations. In our next article, we will tackle wave management with emphasis on lane match ups and how we should manage the wave based on how our champion scales versus how our opponent&#8217;s champion scales.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Hello from the other side, Angelo “Misleading” from Zenith eSports here!</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding proper wave management is a necessary stepping stone on the journey to becoming a competent League of Legends player. Mastering wave management techniques is something you can do to take a step out of mediocrity and make a step towards excellence. Being a master at wave management can make the difference between winning or losing a game (or whether or not you succeed in your promotion series). When you understand proper wave management, you can create interesting opportunities. You are able to cause pressure on specific areas of the map given enough time and patience. You can control how long you or your opponent is vulnerable to jungle ganks or roams. You can also force the enemy team into situations where they have to choose between losing one of two objectives (and even prevent yourself from having to do the same). Effective wave management is an easy skill to learn but it can be relatively difficult to master (unless you have proper guidance).</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Wave Management Factors</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three factors that need to be considered in wave management: <strong>(1) the position of the wave</strong>, <strong>(2) the size of the wave</strong>, and <strong>(3) the flow of the wave.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Position of the wave</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Where are the minions currently fighting on the map? (e.g. in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">middle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of lane)<br />
</span><strong>Size of the wave</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: How large is the minion wave? (e.g. there are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 minions)<br />
</span><strong>Flow of the wave</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Which direction is the minion wave pushing? (e.g. the wave is pushing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">away</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three factors should be regularly communicated to your team. Minions waves are a necessary component in objective-related opportunities. A minion wave’s position can change how vulnerable you or your opponent might be to jungle interference. The size of a minion wave can cause psychological pressure on you or your opponent or it can signal the junglers to head over to dive or defend. The flow of a minion wave can help you predict where the minion wave will be in a certain amount of time. At the end of the day, minion waves influence you, your allies, and your opponent’s positioning and decision-making.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Position</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the <strong>position</strong> of the minion wave is on your opponent’s side, then you are vulnerable to outside interference. If you don’t know where the enemy jungler is or an enemy champion is missing from an adjacent lane, you should play more cautiously. If the position of the wave is on your side, then your opponent is vulnerable to external interference and you should ask your jungler to lend his influence to your lane.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Size</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>size</strong> of the wave creates opportunities to siege objectives or coordinate dives. If a minion wave is large and is about to arrive at the enemy turret, you could call an ally to help dive and kill your opponent under his turret (or do it yourself). On the flip side, if a large minion wave is about to crash into your turret, you should be wary of being dove by your opponents, especially if you are in danger of taking fatal amounts of damage.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Flow</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>flow</strong> of a minion wave will tell you which direction the wave is going and can be used to estimate where the wave will be at a certain point in time. If you can read the flow of minion waves, you can use it to predict when you should be able to pressure objectives. Sometimes, by controlling the flow of minion waves, you can force your opponent to choose between going to lane and defending his turret or joining his team in contesting Dragon. Coordinating this information with your jungler can help him/her adjust his jungle pathing so he can be where he needs to be at the right time.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Basic Wave Management</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two fundamental ways to influence a lane: <strong>(1) Soft/Slow pushing</strong> and <strong>(2) Hard/Fast pushing</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1470"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1470" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush-300x225.png" alt="SoftPush" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush-300x225.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush-600x450.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush-768x576.png 768w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoftPush.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>          <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1468" src="http://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hard-Push-300x225.png" alt="Hard Push" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hard-Push-300x225.png 300w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hard-Push-600x450.png 600w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hard-Push-768x576.png 768w, https://www.zenith.gg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hard-Push.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Soft/Slow Pushing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Soft/Slow pushing</strong> involves disturbing the minion wave as little as possible. The only time you attack minions is when they are within fatal damage from your auto attack. You focus on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">last hitting</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For those of you who don’t know what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">last hitting </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">last hitting</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the process where you only attack minions to deal the killing blow. (Dealing the killing blow to minions earns you a gold reward).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Hard/Fast Pushing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Hard/Fast pushing</strong> involves using your auto attacks and abilities to damage and kill enemy minions. You do not restrict yourself to only </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">last hitting</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You still make an effort</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last hit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but you do not wait for them to reach low health. You actively deal damage to minions regardless of how much health  they have.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Advanced Wave Management</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced wave management takes the fundamentals of basic wave management and applies the three wave management factors of position, size, and flow.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;">Resetting a Minion Wave</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Resetting </strong>the wave is a technique where you influence the lane such that the flow of the minion wave changes. Resetting the wave typically involves hard/fast pushing the minion wave to the enemy turret (or letting your enemy hard/fast push the minion wave into your turret). When done properly, the minion wave should change in flow direction. Defending minions will naturally begin clump as they arrive to defend their turret. This gives the defending minions a combat advantage and give them flow control. If all minions are completely cleared, however, minions will meet in the middle and the flow of the minions wave are neutralized (or in other words, reset).</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">Building a Minion Wave</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Building</strong> a large wave of minions on your own is relatively simple technique. First, you need to establish a slight numbers/health advantage for your minion wave. Not too much of an advantage though because you want to create time for your wave to build. Once you have a small advantage, focus on soft/slow pushing. A great time to switch from soft/slow pushing to hard/fast pushing is when your minion wave is two to three waves large and has a siege minion. The farther away you begin building the wave, the larger the wave can become. The position of where you start building the wave is very important.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Freezing</strong> a minion wave starts off with building a wave for your opponent and letting it soft/slow push towards you and your turret. You want to let the enemy minion wave have an advantage, but you do not want it to be any larger than two waves (12 minions). The key components of a successful freeze is keeping a disadvantage against the enemy minion wave and not allowing the enemy minion wave to enter your turret range. (Remember, you need to make minions crash into turret to break freezes!) Sometimes, it is necessary to take damage form minions to hold the minions in place and prevent them from wandering into turret fire. High health regeneration or a decent amount of lifesteal allows you to freeze for longer.</span></p>
<p>The three images above should guide you on initially setting up a freeze. The three images below show you how to properly freeze your lane whether or not you set it up initially or not.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;">Some Final Words</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your goal is to climb the Ranked ladder or increase your technical prowess, proper wave management will become more and more of a necessity. It’s not always the best option to hard/fast push a minion wave nor is it always the best option to soft/slow push a minion wave.  It all depends on your current situation and the contingencies that exist for that particular situation. How will you know when to apply which  basic or advanced wave management techniques? Experience. The more you practice active wave management, the faster you will understand how to apply and when to apply it. We will go over a variety of situations you can create with effective wave management in another article but until then, try to become a master of wave management by yourself.</span></p>
